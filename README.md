A Short Story
			 									by Jane Doe
								
1-Matt Blast looked at the warped record in his hands and felt worried.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. He had always loved old-fashioned Moscow with its drab, defiant ditches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.
