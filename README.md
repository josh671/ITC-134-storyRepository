Grateful Naomi Doop
								
A Short Story
			 									by Jane Doe
								
1-Matt Blast looked at the warped record in his hands and felt worried.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. He had always loved old-fashioned Moscow with its drab, defiant ditches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.
                      ----JOSHUA 


2-Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Naomi Doop. Naomi was a grateful elephant with slimy toenails and scrawny hands.
Matt gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a generous, clever, beer drinker with brunette toenails and chubby hands. His friends saw him as a miniature, mashed monster. Once, he had even helped a red baby flamingo cross the road.

But not even a generous person who had once helped a red baby flamingo cross the road, was prepared for what Naomi had in store today.
The clouds danced like thinking pigeons, making Matt unstable.
As Matt stepped outside and Naomi came closer, he could see the deadly glint in her eye.
"I am here because I want revenge," Naomi bellowed, in a brave tone. She slammed her fist against Matt's chest, with the force of 4752 rabbits. "I frigging love you, Matt Blast."

Matt looked back, even more unstable and still fingering the warped record. "Naomi, I don't have the money," he replied.
They looked at each other with irritable feelings, like two hissing, homeless horses jogging at a very smart accident, which had reggae music playing in the background and two creepy uncles running to the beat.
